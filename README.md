# Portfolio v4

This is the current version of my personal portfolio website â€” an updated continuation of my project porfolio site from 2020. **v4** keeps the same static HTML/CSS/JS foundation while refreshing my information, design, and links as I actively rebuild a new version using React and Material UI.
I wanted to preserve the 2020 version so I created a new copy for the current updates.

## Overview

- **Type:** Static website (HTML, CSS, JS)
- **Hosting:** Google Cloud Storage
- **CDN & SSL:** Cloudflare
- **Versioning:** Semantic versioning (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`)
- **Purpose:** Keep my live portfolio up to date during the rebuild process

This version focuses on content accuracy and small design improvements â€” not a full technical rebuild (that will launch as v5).

## ðŸš€ Deployment

The site is deployed to Google Cloud Storage and served via Cloudflare:
